# ARGUS

**ARGUS** (*Autonomous Real-time Gimbal for User Sensing*) is a face recognition and tracking system powered by the **ESP32-CAM** and **ESP-IDF**. This project utilizes real-time visual feedback to control a pan-tilt gimbal, keeping a detected face centered in view.

---

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition using ESP-WHO
- Gimbal control (pan/tilt) via PWM-driven MG90/SG90 servos
- Fully embedded â€” no external PC required
- Built with ESP-IDF for maximum performance

---

## Hardware

- ESP32-CAM (AI-Thinker)
- Pan-tilt servo mount (SG90 or MG90)
- External 5V power supply for servos
- Optional: FTDI USB-to-Serial adapter for flashing
